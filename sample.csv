0,SPEAKER_02,3.9150000000000005, Thanks for joining us on Mid-Morning this Thursday. It is almost time for the
1,SPEAKER_00,35.0325," kids to start putting the backpacks on. They're going to have the homework. Oh, man. New study shows that students in those early elementary school years are actually getting too much homework. In the worst case, researchers found children in the first grade had up to three times the workload recommended by education experts. As I said, we assure you this study was done by professionals, not by children. But it is interesting. They have this kind of 10 minute guideline where, in kindergarten, you're supposed to have no homework. In first grade 10 minutes. But Mike, the first graders in this survey, they were doing quite a bit of homework."

3,SPEAKER_01,8.673749999999998, Crazy. I can't I can't think of a first grader having the attention span to do anything for 28 minutes and you made a good point a lot of them are just kind of learning to read
4,SPEAKER_00,6.564374999999998," level you think, what kind of homework 30 minutes a day to a six year old?"
5,SPEAKER_03,5.180624999999999, And isn't it more important at that age to be outside or socializing during some type of activity?
6,SPEAKER_00,0.01687500000000597, you
7,SPEAKER_01,0.01687500000000597, you

14,SPEAKER_01,0.016874999999998863, you
15,SPEAKER_02,11.221874999999997, It's a half an hour in the day. This feels a little bit to me like the same people that want everyone to get a trophy. We want it all to be very simple and we're just complaining about too much homework. A half an hour.
16,SPEAKER_03,4.033124999999998, How far have you started doing homework? Is it in your hands yet? Is it in your hands yet? Is it in your hands yet? Is it in your hands yet? Does it still need homework?
17,SPEAKER_02,1.569375000000008, Is that doing a deal?
18,SPEAKER_02,5.720624999999998, I'm still doing homework myself. That kid can't even get me anywhere. That's where this is coming from. What? This is Saurikres.
19,SPEAKER_00,15.879374999999996," That's where this is coming from. What? This is sour cream. You were just upset about how much calculus you're doing. I like my homework. I want kids to do more. More. Well, yeah. Half an hour. You can go back. Yes. Please do homework with my two kids. At least fun, dad ever."
20,SPEAKER_02,0.30375000000000796," Now,"
21,SPEAKER_01,0.3881250000000023, Ah!

27,SPEAKER_01,0.03375000000001194,
28,SPEAKER_00,0.016874999999998863, you
29,SPEAKER_01,0.1349999999999909, Thank you.
30,SPEAKER_00,0.16875000000000284, Thank you.
31,SPEAKER_02,0.6412499999999994, That ever.
32,SPEAKER_01,0.25312499999999716,
33,SPEAKER_00,0.35437500000000455, Thank you.
34,SPEAKER_01,0.84375, Homework is fine.
35,SPEAKER_00,0.25312500000001137,
36,SPEAKER_01,0.08437499999999432,
37,SPEAKER_00,0.11812500000000625, Thank you.
38,SPEAKER_01,0.05062499999999659,
39,SPEAKER_02,10.614374999999995," Well, to be honest, I am actually looking forward to sitting down with my kids and doing homework with them, but I get that is not something that's going to be a reality or something that's possible for a lot of families."
40,SPEAKER_03,25.11," Well, and that's what part of the study found is that there are certain families, especially poorer families or parents where English is a second language. They are only a high school degree, really. They found only college educated parents felt the most comfortable helping their kids with their home at work long term through school. And then there was no stress in the relationships there. But if they didn't have the education, then there was tremendous stress. Everybody hated the homework. And it was bad for the whole family."
41,SPEAKER_00,0.5062499999999943, Yeah.
42,SPEAKER_00,23.017499999999984," If you think about 10 minutes of homework, 10 minutes would be about a one-page first grade like math worksheet. Which to me, that seems like reasonable. That's enough, right? I mean, if you're doing 30 minutes of homework, basically you're probably doing spelling and math, and you can see why teachers think like this is a good idea. Some parents want it. They feel like the homework means that the kids are learning. I think back to,"
43,SPEAKER_01,1.805624999999992, Which to me that seems like that.
44,SPEAKER_01,11.998125000000016," some of the math homework for me maybe help, but then I look back to maybe Spanish, which I still can kind of speak, but writing out 20 vocab words as wrote. I don't really think that does anything, but waste time to be able to."
45,SPEAKER_00,0.23624999999998408, Thank you.
46,SPEAKER_02,0.4724999999999966,
47,SPEAKER_02,11.002499999999998," be honest. Yeah, my concern would be that they're just doing additional homework to make up for the stuff that they're not learning in class. They're just teaching to a test and they're saying, hey, do this on top of it. That could be a bit of a problem. Kids, you now have an excuse."
48,SPEAKER_00,0.6412499999999852, That's right. That's right.
49,SPEAKER_00,0.3206250000000068, Okay.
50,SPEAKER_00,0.16874999999998863, you.
51,SPEAKER_02,0.4893750000000239, So
52,SPEAKER_00,0.11812499999999204, Take care.
53,SPEAKER_02,2.1937499999999943, That teachers when you go back to school
54,SPEAKER_00,2.0756250000000023, That teacher's when you go back to school.
