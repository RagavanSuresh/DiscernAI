      <td>Thank you.  you  with actually man.  Thank you.  If you're talking about internship livability, I agree of course with my good friend, Mayor Isko, and he's my good friend in reality, because he and I were together in the vice mayor's league. So we started both as vice mayor's and now we're reconciled as mayor's. So it's good to have Manila as our neighbor. But in terms of livability, although you asked me earlier what I wanted to do, it's totally different from the issue of traffic, no? But here in Keson City, one thing that we're trying to do, apart from clearing the streets, which is something that was mandated by the president through his state of the nation address, that we, Mayor's in 60 days, must clear primary, secondary, and Mabuhay lanes of all road constructions and sidewalk obstructions. And in these particular areas, 24-7, you can't go through vendors and other areas. So this is what I'm saying, and we're going through a lot of our best. In addition to this, we're doing what we saw in livability is working towards walkable cities. So we're trying to change our land use plan to make sure that land use plan is not only residential, it's not only a work area commercial, but also a mix of use and water places. To make sure that land use plan is well-known, if you can use a bicycle or a vehicle, ideally, with the use of technology, you don't even have to leave your house to be able to complete a day's work. Right.  You ask me within the next three years. So, this is the present. This is the situation you're describing now. Traffic pollution, workplaces away from the home. The need to use public transportation that is inefficient. The need to bring your own cars, et cetera. And use ads on other roads that are full of obstructions, et cetera. But I'm thinking in the long term. So in the long term, it is about planning. So it's about changing your comprehensive land use plan. It's about changing the mindset of the people towards walkability, towards more compact cities, if you will. We're in all activities that you need to survive to live day by day can be done within a small area of your city.  Thank you.  yet.  Yeah.  ja tablespoons,   Thank you.   you  would have solved that, I think, not?  Federalism. Federalism would have made NCR a region with one elected governor. Tamaba, Yorme.  Aitou?  Maldito.    Minha professor comunquegets na Ã©poca mainviver grub  sa kami yung New Yorker. Kayakunapan sinpunin yung sabay sabay nakamin ang sususped ang klasin.   Ha ha ha!     before, sorry, I'll just mention, so those, I guess not everybody, or not a lot live in Keson City here, but for those of you who do, since you're talking about traffic, I'd like to wind them ahead of time, no, that it will get worse before it will get better. Why is that? Because four of the main build, build, build projects of our president are concentrated in Keson City. For example, 12 of the 14 MRT stations are in Keson City. The seven of the 15 subway stations are in Keson City. The segment 8.2, which is the connector road, connect pin C5 to NLX, it will be in Keson City. And the skyway connecting S-Lex and NLX is in Keson City, passes through Keson City as well. And because the president is rushing, he would like these build, build, build projects to finish before his term ends, which means for us in Keson City, at least and possibly also in Manila, that all of these construction projects will be taking place at the same time. And so in our case, having a had that foresight, that much, that's a problem in traffic, much, much grabbersha and we've talked to the DOTR, DPWH, they said, we don't have time to do it, because it's a plan of the past. We set up a task force, it's called task force, build, build, address, build, build, build. So meaning not only that because when the connector road is built, 18,000 of my informal settler families will be affected. And I have to build housing for them in relation to this. So it's actually quite a difficult situation. But that's why I guess I agree with Mayor Eskot, that the people must participate, they must know that this is happening and the government is now in coordination with various sectors in the city, informing them that this will happen inevitably. What are the mitigating measures that we can put in place now, palang, habang, pinaplan, ito national government so that we can anticipate the inconvenience it will cause and we can adjust our lifestyles while this is going to happen. And then hopefully if the national government fulfills its promise that within X number of years these building or construction projects will be finished, the promise is of course public transportation, which will then ease or lower the cost of living and the traffic situation that you mentioned are at the top of the list of our people. But I'd like to emphasize before there is game, there is pain. And I guess we are entering the pain phase.    Well, in our case, what we're trying to do is build several growth centers in Kessend City. So Kessend City is probably the opposite of the menu. We have  Manila has about half the population of Cassant City, but we are about five times bigger in terms of land area. So we are able to plan for several growth areas. So it's not necessary for us to have just one city center. We can have many city centers. For example, the Kubau can be a city center, the central business district, which is the Trinoma area, can be a central center. The Novaleaches area can be a center. Balintawa can be a center, et cetera. So that's how we're planning to organize our city in terms of different growth areas. So that people do not need to travel long distances to get to places of work. At the same time, you make each area attractive to investors so that each can be its own microcosm. Completo nasanan jane yumangan negociante, nana completona ambawath growth area. So people, this will minimize transportation needs. In other words, I think our country patterned itself too much on the American model, which is car-based, which is distance oriented suburban in lifestyle, but now we have to try to adopt the European model, which is compact city centers in our spaces, not to maximize walkability, pedestrianization, and mixed use of facilities. And I guess that's the way our city is trying to organize itself. Now, of course, you're asking in the short term, I'm kind of a long term thinker. That's why probably I hope that I make it to the end of my nine years. Bah parea, taya, mayor, escoria, gambling, or political capital, because there's so many things we want to do. But actually, in the long term, we have many nice plans for our city. But in the short term, I'll just very briefly say what we're trying to do now is decentralize governance in Guestan City. So all of the malls in Guestan City will now, by January, we have one stop shops where people can pay their taxes. And they don't have to go to the monocity, they don't have to line up anymore. We're trying to move towards a fully automated city by the end of three years. But at least the revenue generating part by the end of this year should be finished. And then we go on and on until at the end of three years, hopefully everything will be online. And people no longer have to go to the city government, the city hall to get transactions done. That's our plan for our city.  Thank you.</td>

      <td>Bye Bye  Thanks for watching.  Well, Mayor Joy already touched on all of the important points and so did Mary's go. And I agree within the first three years the best you can do is cleaning and clearing and the projects that we've been involved with in Iloylo and other cities. That's the first thing that can be done and it's doable and it has to be done and sustained.  Uh.  I do have to remind everyone.  that traffic  is not the problem.  Traffic is just the symptom of the problem of a lack of integrated comprehensive transport system for the whole metropolis.  Thank you.  People always ask me, can you solve traffic? Then that's the wrong question.  The thing is to provide Metro Manila in all of our metro areas all around the country with a comprehensive transport system. And that is rail-based mass transport system, non-motorized bikes and walking. And that's where you have to tweak the priorities of the DPWH and all of the national agencies towards that type of infrastructure. We've been involved in a number of initiatives in Makati, in Pasig. And these are for pedestrian systems.  except that the cost of them is too small to even get into the notice of the OTR. Most of the projects are sub 500 million. Ang tiniti ng nanilat dahil bill-bill-bill is the multi-billion pass all. All we're asking is  One support of a skyway, vertical roads, one supporting structure will build 10 pedestrian bridges. Yet we don't have pedestrian bridges. Just try crossing any of our major thoroughfares. So we need, like Mayor Joyce said, a re-alignment of our priorities from just pure car-based infrastructure to more comprehensive transport systems.   Domino effect. Domino effect.  Or did I folks like  If I may, that's a very good point. Sure. And the fact that brothers Bredo brought it out. And he mentioned the word I wanted to hear with this citizenship.  We all are citizens of this metropolis and of the individual cities. Yet we don't identify ourselves as such. We've lost the connection where we live.  We're more lasalians or I'm sorry, at the end.  than we are of where we were.  So the first thing I ask of people is where do you live and what do you call yourselves?  Thank you.   you   ÐÐ¸ ÑÑÑÐ° Ð²Ð¾Ð¹Ð½Ð°!  Pero iyan nga po. Iyong tinata ng pupusam ng audience ko.  Anong tinata ako nisasarili niyo. If you're from Manile, you're called Manile. Niyo.  ba atang may nila?  If you're from Cassin City or cold.  I used to live in Cassian City, I called myself JEP Prox.  But the point is that if we are to build better cities, we have to make reconnect people to where they live. If they don't feel pride in where they live, they won't call themselves off that place. And that's what we lack today.  Thank you.  ...p lÃ¤ngâ K ã¾amat.  one.   Get in, in you piece, in you piece.  I think everyone will agree that they will, if you want to ease the pain.  if you're really expected to  double our commute time is that they  make our Wi-Fi twice as fast.  but at one half the cost, right?  You can browse. And then we will suffer in silence.  That's funny.  I think after there are nine years, the next step would be for everyone to vote for either of them as governor of Metro Manila.  But just one very quick, and this is very good to have such a discourse on cities and quality of our lives here.  I would invite you all for those of you who haven't finished your degrees yet. To think about the career in urban planning.  They're only 6,000 of us in the profession. There are 60,000 architects. We have world-class buildings, but once you step out, you get run over. So we need, and all of this mayors, their plantilias require urban planners and landscape architects and urban designers. We need people in the planning professions to be able to help us all.  move to that brighter future.</td>

      <td>Hi.  I'm Chai Hovelenia, I will be your moderator for the panel this afternoon.  And I'd like to call to the stage our two mayors, Matromanila mayors, we're very lucky to have them, Mayor Joy Belmonte of Casson City.  Mayor Iskaw Morano of Manila.  Thank you.  and Paolo Alcazarin.  Urban planner who I'm sure you've heard about and you've read his pieces.  Okay, so this afternoon what will be tackling will be making metro areas livable. This is something that I know is very close to your heart as it is to mine because every single day we feel that  things are getting worse and they're not getting better. So.  I'd like to introduce a little more formally our panelists. Mayor Joy Belmonte served as vice mayor of Cassandra City for nine long years before she finally became mayor.  She was elected this year.  Um,  Mayor Belmontis Advocacies have focused on the protection and upholding of rights of women and children, gender fairness, economic empowerment of women, mental health, culture and the arts. Also, please welcome in the flesh, not just on Facebook Live, Mayor Isco Moreno.  He has been promoting open governance, and I think this is the reason why you see him really on Facebook. That's part of the effort. He also recently led clearing operations in Manila and also announced his commitment to preserve and expand the Aroseros Forest Park.  And finally, let's welcome our urban planning expert, Paulo Alcazaran. He has been a practicing design consultant for the last 38 years. That's almost four decades. Some of those years were spent in Singapore. Paulo's advocacies include heritage, conservation, green cities, bringing back usable sidewalks, parks, and plazas to our cities. If you're familiar with the Iloilo Esplanade, I don't know if some of you are from Iloilo here.  and the pedestrian and park networks of Makati and Oritigas, that's Paolo's handy work.  Okay, so let's move on to our discussion this afternoon.  As I said earlier, I'm sure that you feel the congestion. You feel that this city is about to explode. And the mayors, I'm sure, also have their plates very full. And part of the reality is they only have the ears.  One term is good for three years. Of course, they can seek re-election and be in office for as long as nine years. Maybe I'd like to start by asking, what are your priorities given?  given the reality of a short or long-term limit of nine years. What are you prioritizing to make your respective cities more livable?  May I call you Scott? I'll see you at Scott.  ×¡× ××¨ ×©×ª×××   you   So you're saying that Ampina Khaduwa Ball is clearing operations. So you're clearing operations. Are you, is that the same priority for you, Joy?  ability.  I have a quick question. When you say what you're meeting in Sakhyan,  Walk if you can, use your bikes if you can.  I think you experienced the na me in natin, is that...  Number one, pollution. Pag nagbay kako along ed sa, I'm in danger, kasi mababangga ako nga mga bus or malalang hub ko yung maraming hangin.  And second, walaang protection for pedestrians. If you walk along many of the main thoroughfairs, or even kait yung small streets, para ang walaang mahitang sidewalk, because as we mentioned earlier, vendors have taken over some of these sidewalks. So, popaan nyo, how do you...  How do you address that? Even if I want to?  But  Walaang incentive for me, and it may not be safe also. ì  Okay, you mentioned planning, perfect segue to Paolo. What do you say to this?  Merean bang ganong plans for Manila, the setting up a pedestrian network, a pedestrian system.   Yes.  ... okay, you mentioned an interesting point to Nina about Hindi lang local government na patito ono, it's not just the main course, but...  and the heart everyone has to get involved.  Yes.  Do you have other ideas also how, or do our folks like us can participate? Yes.  Thank you.  correct.  Thank you.  you  Parang if you notice also, masyadong segregated, parang yung problema, problema ng manila yan, problema ng Kesun City, problema ng Pasi, problema ng Makati.  without integrated.  approach I think.    MNDA.  you  But the problem is...  And this problem has been there forever. Metro Manila consists of mayors who are elected, 1617 mayors who are elected.  And you have MMDA that's led by someone who is not elected, but who is appointed.  ...and ang papel niya is to coordinate. So para ang ako ang mayor, bakit ka magdivicta sa akin, ehuala ka naman hina-lal.  Isn't that the problem also structurally organizationally?  Actually.  a million dollars.   Thank you.     You are going to use your Spanish completely no-we're gonna use it, dude..' okay  I'd like to tell you about a survey that Rappler ran among its readers and interesting your results. So, hindi naman ganoong kaisurpising yung results, kasi lumabas dintalaga. We ask our readers about their wish list.  kung baga, ang gusto ninyon ay prioritais ng mga mayors at least in Metro Manila. And this is what came out.  Ha ha.  Congratulations of classes though. Number one is traffic and transportation.  47% overwhelmingly, 47% close to half of respondents. Habitila, unahan yung traffic and transportation. So mass transportation, public transportation. Tapo second is lower cost of living. So I guess, nara randa man nara rinto ng tao eh. That it's become so much more expensive and the income is not enough.  So, me economics, the land.  end.  Pero ang layo, compared to traffic, 12.6% lang.  and then third, this crime prevention.  Fourth is Health Services Accessibility, and fifth is support for education services.  ØµØ­ÙØ­Ø© ÙØ¹ Ø§ÙÙÙ Ø·ÙØ²ÙØ§ ÙÙÙ thought  and be gusto.  Okay, so you have to be ready for this. On average, we're told that Filipinos now spend about 66 minutes on the road because of traffic. Daily, daily. So if you're saying that things will get worse, in 66 minutes will probably become double.  How can we alleviate this?  Magiging masmanageable ito. If it's going to get worse anyway, and we can't do anything about it because of the infrastructure.  promise.  time can see.  Thank you.  kay iso commitment&lt;|tl|&gt;  much smaller than Cassian city.  But my question is...  Ganan alang bayon.  Iti iti isin ng naten, and we adopt, and be resilient.  That may be, uh, again.  just one one this one from all over the world.  So you can work anywhere.  Thank you.    Could you tell us about that? Maybe because we have limited time.  The last question is from the three of you. Maybe share your plans or your insights about it.  how things can be better and how living in the city in the metro can be a better experience.  Okay, so for those, I don't know if there are any of you from Casson City here that's something to look forward to.  ë´ë´ì.  Thank you.  Scott.   So I knew...  you  I'm just kidding.  lol  Ok, entÃ£o Ã© claro que Ã© muito participatory, nÃ£o?  Yes.  So, okay, we don't have enough time anymore, so we'd like to thank...  our mayors for joining us. I know this is a very complicated and complex problem. Hindi to, I'm not going to use that in just 30 minutes, but as they have pointed out, it's really important for each and every one of us to be part of the process.  and to also hold them into account if they don't deliver on their promises. But bantayan natin ang Isatisa, but citizens have to do their part as well. Thank you very much. Thank you. It's God. Thank you, Joy. And thank you, Paola.</td>
